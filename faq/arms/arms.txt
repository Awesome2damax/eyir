**Q:** With only 1 Test of Might trait, do I still delay Bladestorm till the Test of Might Window?
**A:** Yes, even with 1 trait only it's still worth to delay Bladestorm. On Burst AoE it's fine to ignore the ToM trait.

**Q:** When do I use the Crushing Assault proc?
**A:** Before Execute use it like you would use Slam. In Execute you want to use it as soon as it procs.

**Q:** Is it ok to sit on Skullsplitter?
**A:** Yes, the power of Skullsplitter comes from the near on demand rage. Sitting on it when you are high rage is fine.

**Q:** Is Mortal Strike used in the Execute phase?
**A:** At this point no, the DPR of Execute and MS with 2 OP stacks is basically even. However in practice it's better to keep using Execute as it doesn't slow the rotation as much.

**Q:** Do you wait for 40 rage to cast Execute?
**A:** No, you want to use execute at any rage, the DPR scales linearly.
