***ARMS FAQ***

**Trait FAQ**

__What are the best traits?__

Single target: Crushing Assault, Striking the Avnil, Test of Might.
AoE: Lord of War, Gathering Storm.
Mythic Plus: 3x Lord of War, Gathering Storm is fine too.
A more complete list here - <https://bloodmallet.com/index.html#warrior_arms?data_view=azerite_traits&type=trait_stacking&tier=3>

__How/Which traits stack?__
Striking the Anvil - Only the Overpower Damage .
Crushing Assault -  Only the Slam damage.
Test of Might - Strength bonus does stack.
Lord of War - CS/WB Damage stacks, not the rage gained.
Seismic Wave - Damage Stacks.
Gathering Storm - Strength Stacks.

__With only 1 Test of Might trait, do I still delay Bladestorm till the Test of Might Window?__
Yes, even with 1 trait only it's still worth to delay Bladestorm. On Burst AoE it's fine to ignore the ToM trait.

__When do we use the Crushing Assault proc?__
 Before Execute you'd use it like you're just casting Slam. In Execute you want to use it procs.

**Stats FAQ**

__What is the general stat priority?__
Haste > Crit > Strength > Versatility > Mastery
**THIS CAN VARY FROM CHARACTER TO CHARACTER PLEASE SIM FOR MORE ACCURATE WEIGHTS**

__Are there any breakpoints we need to aim for?__
No, there are tons of breakpoints that are not impactful outside of a sim. Keep getting more Haste and Crit.

**Talent FAQ**

__Is Avatar or In for the Kill better for M+?__
In for the Kill is generally better, however Avatar can be used if you co-ordiante with your group for large pulls.

__Is Fervor of Battle viable in M+?__
No, Massacre is still much better for single target and AoE. 

__Rend sims higher, should I use it over Massacre?__
No, Rend may sim higher but is worse in practice. Massacre is much easier to abuse.

__Is Second Wind Viable?__
Yes, in some cases in raid "Environmental" damage doesn't break Second Winds healing. Ex: Mythrax and Bursting/Greivous in M+.

**Rotation FAQ**

__Do you wait for 40 rage to cast Execute?__
No, you want to use execute at any rage, the DPR scales linearly. 

__Is Mortal Strike used in the Execute phase?__
At this point no, the DPR of Execute and MS with 2 OP stacks is basically even. However in real practice it's better to keep using Execute as it doesn't slow the rotation as much.

__Is it ok so sit on Skullsplitter>__
Yes, the power of Skullsplitter comes from the near on demand rage. Sitting on it when you are high rage is fine.

__What is the opener?__
Without Test of Might
Charge > Warbreaker/Colossus Smash > Bladestorm > Regular Rotation

With Test of Might
Charge > Skullsplitter > Warbreaker/Colossus Smash > Regular Rotation > Bladestorm when Colossus Smash fades.

**General FAQ**
__What are the best races for Arms?__
For Horde: Undead, Blood Elf, Goblin. 
For Alliance: Lightforged Draenei, Gnome, Void Elf.
For Mythic plus: Blood Elf is strong due to Arcane Torrent, and Night Elf is great too for Shadowmeld.

__Is Arms or Fury better for M+?__
Fury is generally considered to be better than Arms, however Arms is still a viable spec.

__Is Arms or Fury better for Raid?__
As of now in Uldir both specs trade blows on fights. For Battle of Dazar'alor we don't know yet.
*You can look at logs here for a more clear idea* <https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/19#class=Warrior&spec=Melee>

__What does Arms excell at?__
Arms is particuarly good at 2-target cleave and burst AoE. It's single target is quite weak.

__Is there a BiS list?__
Not really, with Titanforging making a lot of gear relevant it's hard to acquire said "BiS". Every character is vastly different.

__What Potion does Arms use?__
Bursting Blood is better on single target, Strength better for AoE. However the Strength pot is almost as good as Bursting Blood in Single Target.

__What are the best Trinkets for Arms?__
Since Titanforging makes a lot of gear relevant, you can check out the Bloodmallet list here. - <https://bloodmallet.com/index.html#warrior_arms>
