**__FAQ__**

**Q:** What are the best traits?
**A:** 
Single-target: Test of Might and Meticulous Scheming are the 2 best, other good "1 of's" are Crushing Assault and Striking the Anvil.
AoE: Lord of War > Gathering Storm > Rest. Test of Might also has value if the targets live long enough to Bladestorm through the buff.

**Q:** With only 1 Test of Might trait, do I still delay Bladestorm till the Test of Might Window?
**A:** Yes, even with 1 trait only it's still worth to delay Bladestorm. On Burst AoE it's fine to ignore the ToM trait.

**Q:** When do I use the Crushing Assault proc?
**A:** Before Execute use it like you would use Slam. In Execute you want to use it as soon as it procs.

**Q:** Does Crushing Assault work with Fervor of Battle?
**A:** Yes, the trait reduces the rage cost of Whirlwind by 20 and increases the Slam cast damage.

**Q:** What are the best Essences for Arms?
**A:** Single Target: Lucid Dreams major, Focusing Iris first minor, Conflict and Strife or Crucible of Flame for second minor.
AoE: Focusing Iris Major, Purification Protocol, Conflict and Strife or Lucid minors.

**Q:** Is it ok to sit on Skullsplitter?
**A:** Yes, the power of Skullsplitter comes from the near on demand rage. Sitting on it's cooldown during lucid or high rage is fine.

**Q:** Is Mortal Strike used in the Execute phase?
**A:** No, Mortal Strike is not used in Execute at all.
