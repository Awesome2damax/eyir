In for the Kill is generally better, however Avatar can be used if you co-ordiante with your group for large pulls.

No, Massacre is still much better for single target and AoE.

No, Rend may sim higher but is worse in practice. Massacre is much easier to abuse.

**Rotation FAQ**

__Do you wait for 40 rage to cast Execute?__
No, you want to use execute at any rage, the DPR scales linearly. 

__Is Mortal Strike used in the Execute phase?__
At this point no, the DPR of Execute and MS with 2 OP stacks is basically even. However in real practice it's better to keep using Execute as it doesn't slow the rotation as much.

Yes, the power of Skullsplitter comes from the near on demand rage. Sitting on it when you are high rage is fine.
