__THIS CAN VARY FROM CHARACTER TO CHARACTER PLEASE SIM FOR MORE ACCURATE WEIGHTS__

**Q:** Are there any breakpoints we need to aim for?
**A:** No, there are tons of breakpoints that are not impactful outside of a sim. Keep getting more Haste and Crit.

**Q:** Is Avatar or In for the Kill better for M+?
**A:** In for the Kill is generally better, however Avatar can be used if you coordinate with your group for large pulls or for Reaping pulls.

**Q:** Is Fervor of Battle viable in M+?
**A:** No, Massacre is still much better for single-target and AoE. 

**Q:** Rend/FoB sims higher, should I use it over Massacre?
**A:** Depends, Rend/FoB are less flexible than Massacre in raids, but are equally as viable if not better in BoD/CoS 

**Q:** Is Second Wind Viable?
**A:** Yes, in some cases in raid "Environmental" damage doesn't break Second Winds healing. Ex: Mythrax and Bursting/Greivous in M+.

**Q:** What Potion does Arms use?
**A:** Bursting Blood is better on single-target, Strength better for AoE. However the Strength pot is almost as good as Bursting Blood in single-target.

**Q:** How do we use Grong's Primal Rage?
**A:** It's typically used after the opener when you're not going to rage cap. It does not scale with CS/ToM so it's a waste to use during those windows.

**Q:** How do we use Ramping Amplitude Gigavolt Engine?
**A:** Engine should be used about 8s before a CS cast, even on pull you'd precast it.
