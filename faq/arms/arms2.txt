**Q:** Are there any breakpoints we need to aim for?
**A:** No, there are tons of breakpoints that are not impactful outside of a sim. 

**Q:** What talents/traits should I take for M+?
**A:** 
For lower keys. Your talent set up is Skullsplitter,Storm Bolt, Massacre,Defensive Stance,Warbreaker,In for the Kill and Anger Management. Paired with as many Lord of War and Gathering storm traits.  

For Higher keys, (15+ usually) the talents are similar. However you can also opt in to use Fervor of Battle and Cleave for talents and use Test of Might traits. Generally used with Lucid Dreams as a major. In higher keys mobs tend to live longer and some pulls are bigger, which gives more potential for Cleave and Test of Might to pump out some serious AoE damage while still having decent single target.

__Both builds are equally viable in higher keys, it really depends on how your group pulls and the composition of said group.__
