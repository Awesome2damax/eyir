**Q:** How much of <insert stat here> do I need? How do my stats look?
**A:** You do not need a certain amount of any particular stat, nor do you need or want a certain distribution of stats. You simply want the most amount of total stats possible. That means going for item level.

Your gear and stats are a lot less meaningful to tanking than your actual play. So, if you're struggling on appropriately geared content, it's because you are playing poorly. Read the guide, learn the spec, and learn to make your own decisions.

**Q:** Iâ€™m having trouble keeping aggro on enemies, why is that?
**A:** Make sure you're using your damaging cooldowns like Avatar as often as possible while also following the proper ability priority order. Protection has extremely high damage output and as a result extremely high threat output. If you are having threat issues you are likely making mistakes.

**Q:** What Legendary should I use for Raids / Mythic+?
**A:** For raids you should use The Wall for the increased Rage generation and Shield Wall reduction. For Mythic+ where you can constantly hit 2+ enemies with Thunder Clap you should use Thunderlords together with Booming Voice.

**Q:** What is the best Covenant choice?
**A:** Whichever Covenant you choose you can still do all your dailiy activities. For general purposes the order would be Kyrian >= Night Fae > Necrolord/Venthyr.
This order is not set in stone as Covenants are prone to be buffed and nerfed throughout Shadowlands.
