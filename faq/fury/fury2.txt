**Q:** What are the best talents?
**A:** ST Venthyr: Sudden Death, Massacre, Cruelty, Dragon Roar, Siegebreaker/AM
ST non-Venthyr: Sudden Death, Frenzy, Cruelty, Dragon Roar, Reckless Abandon
M+ Talents: Fresh Meat, Massacre, Cruelty, Bladestorm, Anger Management (Use Signet of Tormented Kings legendary)

**Q:** Should I be enraged before using Recklessness if I have Signet?
**A:** Yes, try and get enraged before using Recklessness. The biggest tip is if you have Signet, try and use Recklessness during your GCD downtime after a Rampage/Fresh Meat Bloodthirst. This is because even if you are in a GCD, if Reck procs Bladestorm it will still trigger and you lose nothing, and your GCD downtime is being eaten by the Bladestorm.

**Q:** Do I cancel Bladestorm on Single Target if Signet procs it?
**A:** You want to cancel Bladestorm, proc or natural cast, if you have Condemn available to press or are above 90 rage.
