**Q:** How good is Geti'ikku?
**A:** The weapon is very strong on Single Target, however do keep in mind that it loses value in multi-target situations due to the DoT being Single Target only and the weapon missing secondary stats.

**Q:** Are there any alternate talents for Mythic+?
**A:** Bladestorm is a very strong choice in Mythic+, and can lead to better results depending on pulls.
Reckless Abandon is also very strong for more infrequent but much stronger burst, and it pairs very well with Blood of the Enemy major essence which is a very strong and popular choice for Mythic+.
Anger Management is another potential choice for Mythic+ as it pairs well with Bladestorm.
Inner Rage is a good choice on specifically Explosive weeks in order to ensure you can kill the Explosive orbs, however it's overall damage is lackluster compared to Sudden Death due to how inferior Raging Blow is compared to Bloodthirst due to Cold Steel Hot Blood.

**Q:** Are there alternate talents for Ny'alotha?
**A:** Furious Slash is a very strong Single Target talent and has use on quite a few bosses in Ny'alotha. These bosses are mainly Maut, Skitra, Xanesh, Shad'har, and Ra-den. It is also useable on Wrathion, Vexiona, Il'gynoth, and Drest'agath but it is slightly awkward due to forced downtime and/or adds and I would recommend just using Sudden Death instead.
Bladestorm is a very strong choice on Hivemind and Carapace due to the timings on add spawns working out well for Bladestorm.

**Q:** Are there stat breakpoints?
**A:** There are no stat breakpoints that you should be specifically aiming for. Just follow your top gear sims instead of worrying about specific stat amounts.
