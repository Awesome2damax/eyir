**Q:** With Reckless Flurry, do I delay Recklessness for Siegebreaker?

**Q:** If I have Cold Steel Hot Blood do I prioritize Bloodthirst over Raging Blow?
**A:** If you have 2 Cold Steel Hot Blood traits you do prioritize Bloodthirst over Raging Blow at all times, even during enrage and while at 2 Raging Blow stacks.

**Q:** How strong is Infinite Fury?
**A:** Assuming you have Cold Steel Hot Blood, Infinite Fury is one of the strongest traits on paper but in practice it does lose value. If you have any downtime it hurts the value of the trait a lot. Even if it does lose value on some bosses, the trait is still a good choice if it sims a good amount higher than your other choice (at least >0.5% more).
In The Eternal Palace, Infinite Fury is generally a weaker trait and should not be used unless it far surpasses other options.

**Q:** What enchants do I use? 
**A:** Deadly Navigation and Force Multiplier, however many aspects of gear affects this. Benthic, essences, geti'iiku, and trinkets can all sway enchants to things like quick and versatile navigation. In general for enchants and gems sim yourself for a complete answer.
