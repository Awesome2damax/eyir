**Q:** With Reckless Flurry, do I delay Recklessness for Siegebreaker?
**A:** Holding Recklessness is the marginally better choice in most situations.

**Q:** If I have Cold Steel Hot Blood do I prioritize Bloodthirst over Raging Blow?
**A:** If you have 2 Cold Steel Hot Blood traits you do prioritize Bloodthirst over Raging Blow at all times, even during enrage and while at 2 Raging Blow stacks.

**Q:** How strong is Infinite Fury?
**A:** Assuming you have Cold Steel Hot Blood, Infinite Fury is one of the strongest traits on paper but in practice it does lose a lot of value with any forced downtime off the boss. In Ny'alotha, I would heavily recommend avoiding the use of Infinite Fury as most bosses have plenty of ways to foce you away from the boss. 

**Q:** What enchants/gems do I use? 
**A:** Deadly Navigation and Versatile Navigation is often the most powerful combination of weapon enchants, and Critical Strike Ring Enchants and Gems. However enchants and gems are very subject to your specific character, and simming yourself will give you much better and accurate results.
