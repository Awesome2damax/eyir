**A:** If you have 2 Cold Steel Hot Blood traits you do prioritize Bloodthirst over Raging Blow at all times, even during enrage and while at 2 Raging Blow stacks.

**Q:** How strong is Infinite Fury?
**A:** Assuming you have Cold Steel Hot Blood, Infinite Fury is one of the strongest traits on paper but in practice it does lose value. If you have any downtime it hurts the value of the trait a lot. Even if it does lose value on some bosses, the trait is still a good choice if it sims a good amount higher than your other choice (at least >0.5% more).
In Battle of Daz'alor, Infinite Fury is weak on the following bosses: Jadefire Masters, Opulence, Conclave of the Loa, Mekkatorque.

**Q:** What enchants do I use? 
**A:** Quick and Masterful Navigation, however if you have Cold Steel Hot Blood then you might sim higher with Deadly Navigation. This can lead to either Quick+Deadly or Deadly+Masterful (Mainhand vs Offhand makes no difference). Sim yourself to be sure.
