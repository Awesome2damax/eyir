__**FOR THE MOST ACCURATE ANSWER TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS, ALWAYS SIM YOURSELF**__

**Q:** What is the best Covenant?
**A:** :Condemn: **Ven'thyr** is the best overall covenant in PvE. It performs the best by a good margin in the raid and still performs very well in M+ due to Fury's ability to cleave Condemn. :Aftershock: **Night Fae** is close behind on ST and ahead on AoE, although it does suffer from inconsistency if the mobs move out of the AoE. :Spear: **Kyrian** is a behind Night Fae on both ST and AoE but it is easy to use, and :fuckingtrash: **Necrolord** is not worth considering. 

**Q:** What are the best Potency Conduits?
**A:** 
**Potency Conduits**: ST = Ashen Juggernaut (if Venthyr) > Depths of Insanity > Jugg (Non Venthyr)Vicious Contempt > Covenant Conduits
AoE = Depths of Insanity > Convenant Conduits

**Q:** What is the best Legendary? 
**A:** **Deathmaker** is the strong for Single Target and sustained 2 target cleave. **Signet of Tormented Kings** is the best at 3+ targets and is always your choice in M+. Generally craft Deathmaker on Legs, and Signet on Ring. Haste/Mastery are the most consistent stats for the legendaries.

**Q:** What are the best soulbinds?
**A:** Venthyr: Nadjia > Theotar > Draven
Night Fae: Niya > Korayn > Dreamweaver
Kyrian: Pelagos > Forgelite > Kleia
Necrolord: :warrior:
