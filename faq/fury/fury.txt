Q: With Reckless Flurry, do I delay Recklessness for Siegebreaker?
A: Holding Recklessness is the marginally better choice in most situations. Not holding Recklessness is only strictly better with very specific kill timings.

Q: What enchants do I use? 
A: Quick and Masterful Navigation, doesn't matter in which hand as long as you have one of each.

Q: How good is Geti'ikku?
A: The weapon is good on single-target, however it loses value in most multitarget situations due to secondary stats being better.

Q: Is there any time I use *x* talent?
A: The standard talents of 2120123 are good for everything, and will give you strong results on every boss in Uldir as well in Mythic+. There are a few situational talents that can be used though.
Inner Rage, Bladestorm, Anger Management and Reckless Abandon all have use in Mythic+, and the first three can see slight use in Uldir.

Q: Should I use *x* trinket?
A: Go to https://bloodmallet.com/index.html#warrior_fury for a general list. **SIM YOURSELF FOR BEST RESULTS**

Q: Are there stat breakpoints?
A: No

Q: What potion do I use?
A: Bursting Blood for pure single-target, Strength Pot for everything else.
