**Q:** With Reckless Flurry, do I delay Recklessness for Siegebreaker?
**A:** Holding Recklessness is the marginally better choice in most situations.

**Q:** What enchants do I use? 
**A:** Quick and Masterful Navigation, however if you have Cold Steel Hot Blood then you might sim higher with Deadly Navigation. This can lead to either Quick+Deadly or Deadly+Masterful (Mainhand vs Offhand makes no difference). Sim yourself to be sure.
